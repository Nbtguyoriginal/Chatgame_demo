Items should be returned in a structured format to facilitate easy parsing. Each item should be enclosed within curly braces `{}` and should have a `name`, `description`, and `type` attribute at a minimum. Multiple items should be separated by a comma `,`. Here's the format to follow:

{
    "name": "Item Name",
    "description": "Brief description of the item.",
    "type": "Type of the item (e.g., weapon, potion, armor)"
}

For example, if the player discovers a sword and a health potion, the items section in the response should look like this:

{
    "name": "Silver Sword",
    "description": "A sharp sword made of silver.",
    "type": "weapon"
},
{
    "name": "Health Potion",
    "description": "A potion that restores health.",
    "type": "potion"
}

Ensure that items are returned in this structured format to enable the game script to automatically parse and process them.
